         <h2>About Me</h2>
            Hello, My name Dylan Ledermann. I am currently a Sophomore at UCSD pursuing a degree in STEM and hoping to get a CS related job once I graduate.
            I became interested in computer science after taking one of the CS classes at my high school, Mira Costa High School.
            During high school, I took 2 out of the 3 computer science class that were available. 
            The one I didn't take was an introductory class, which I was allowed to skip after learning the material over the summer.
            After high school, I took the computer science courses at UCSD when I was able to get into the class and have currently taken 5 computer science related class.
